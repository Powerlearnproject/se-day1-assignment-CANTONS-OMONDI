#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering refers to the systemic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to design, develop, test, and maintain high-quality software applications.
Software Engineering is important in the technology industry. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power aspects of modern life, such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare. It also provides a way to manage the resources, schedule, and budget for the project and ensure collaboration within the team.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages – in the 1940s, machine language was used to program the earliest computers despite being tedious and error-prone. In the 1950s, assembly language that uses mnemonic codes was introduced to write machine instructions. High-level languages were introduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s when IBM developed the first high-level programming language called FORTRAN in 1957. Other high-level programming languages were later developed, such as COBOL (1959), LISP (1958), and ALGOL (1958-1960). Procedural and structured programming languages such as Pascal and C were later developed in 1970 and 1972. In the 1980s, object-oriented programming languages such as Simula, Smalltalk, C++, and Objective-C were developed. Scripting and Dynamic languages such as Perl, Python, Java and Javascript were developed in the 1990s. Modern and functional languages such as Ruby, C#, Scala, Go, Swift, and Kotlin have been developed since the early 2000s.
Establishment of Software Engineering as a Discipline - The NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 led to the coining of the word Software Engineering. The Waterfall Model, introduced by Winston Royce in 1970, was one of the first formalized software development methodologies.
The advent of structured programming - control structures such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines made programs more readable and maintainable.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements – involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - This phase involves creating high-level and detailed designs for the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation – involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing – involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment – this is the phase where the software is released to the users or customers.
Maintenance – involves providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall—This is a sequential approach with distinct phases, such as requirements, design, and implementation, flowing downwards like a waterfall. Waterfall would be applicable in large-scale infrastructure projects such as building a new airport terminal.
Agile – this is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Agile would be applicable in Product Development with Evolving Requirements such as creating an e-commerce platform with frequently changing features based on user feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer -ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager – oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes. An example of IDEs include Visual Studio and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS) – for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. An example of VCS is Github.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements – requirements may change during the development cycles leading to scope creep and project delays. This challenge can be overcome by embracing agile methodologies, maintaining continuous stakeholder communication, and prioritizing requirements.
Tight deadlines – pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. This challenge can be overcome by setting realistic time estimation, prioritization and focus, and implementing time management techniques.
Technical debt - Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. This challenge can be overcome through regular code reviews and refactoring, and adopting best practices and coding standards.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing – involves testing individual components or modules of a software.
Integration testing – testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing – testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of testing: detecting defects early, ensuring functionality, improving software reliability, validating performance ensuring security, facilitating compliance, improving user experience, proving confidence in the software, supporting continuous improvement, and enabling smooth deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to elicit desired responses from AI language models like GPT, Copilot, and Gemini. It involves crafting the input text in a way that maximizes the effectiveness and relevance of the model's output.
Importance of Prompt Engineering in interacting with AI models: Optimizes output quality, guides AI behaviour, enhances user experience, and solves complex tasks.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Explain the substitution rules.
Improved prompt: Explain comprehensively the substitution rules in football regarding the English Premier League.
An improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific, and concise.
